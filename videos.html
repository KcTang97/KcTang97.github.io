      <h6>Heart Window, 1920 x 1080, Digital Vdieo, 2 min 56 sec, 2018</h6>
      <p> I used the darkroom to symbolize our/my inner heart, the window as the sight.<br>
        I want the audience to experience the two directly opposite world with the soundtrack.<br>
        Experience the world of an introvert, people with trauma or autism live.<br>
        It is not a work to express negative emotion about these groups to the viewer, <br>
        but to have a different perspective to be able to see the different sides of them, a relaxed and free side.</p>

      <h6>Fire, 1920 x 1080, Digital Video 2 min 12 sec, 2018</h6>
      <p>Wildfire, one of the common disasters caused by us humans, only people who experienced know its crucial and pain. <br>
        Fire, it keeps coldness away from us, but it is dangerous and harmful, wildfire is the best answer.<br>
        I want to express the seriousness of wildfire and remind people of the harmfulness of fire.</p>

      <h6>Audio/Video Project, 1920 x 1080, Digital Video, 1 min 30 sec, 2019 </h6>
      <p>This project is just about a tryout by combining audio and video. <br>
        In the video, I combine many 4-10 second short videos and play around with the transition effects. <br>
        I have this idea from some social media where people play their short videos with transition effects, and it looks very cool. <br>
        So, I try a similar way in this video.</p>

      <h6>Sky creatures, 1920 x 1080, Digtal drawing and animation, 17 sec, 2019</h6>
      <p>Whenever I feel tired and need to relax, I always look up the sky and imagine all the shapes of clouds as creatures.</p>

      <h6>Dream, 1920 x 1080, Digtal drawing and animation, 1 min 22 sec, 2019</h6>
      <p> This project is about a dream I have had in many years ago, <br>
        and I still remember one of the incredible scenes, it is so beautiful and unforgettable, so I decided to animate it.<br>
        Because the dream was a long time ago and I only remember the last part of it,<br>
        so I choose to go along with the concept of family moments, the happy moments.<br>
        Everything that is animated is the sketches I made through Photoshop. <br>
        For the ending of my animation, I take the idea from class critique in the previous class, so it ends better and emotion.</p>

      <h3>Viruses(AR), 1920 x 1080, Augmented Readlity, 24 seconds, 2020</h3>
            <p> This project was created in March 2020, during the very beginning of the pandemic.<br>
                We never know what is virus looks like, and we can never see it through eyes.<br>
                Therefore we never know its infection.<br>
                An AR perspective of viewing viruses is a way to establish a sense of viruses that can be anywhere around us in daily life.<br>
                To keep people in mind that many viruses are extremely contagious, harmful, and dangerous.<br>
                We should never think it's never a big deal.</p>

      <h3>Virus Animation, 1920 x 1080, Digtal drawing and animation, 3 minutes 45 seconds, 2020</h3>
            <p>The animation is a series I am creating specifically for the period we live in now. <br>
               In this series, I am using both AfterEffect and Photoshop for the entire series due to my artist practice. <br>
               The content of this is to explore the emotion and reaction of people from everyday news reports I seem on the television and network.<br>
               Also, the perspective of people like me viewing this health crisis. <br>
               The reason I called it Animation 345 is because I want the length of this animation to be the actual day, which is 345 days.<br>
               Pretend when a disaster like the animation shows, or the crisis we live in now. <br>
               The duration of the crisis can end quickly, like the length of this video 345 days.<br>
               If countries from all over the world work together, accept each other's efforts in solving the crisis. <br>
               The crisis now and the crisis in the future will be less pain, less depressing, and less stressful for everyone compare to what happened up to this period.</p>
