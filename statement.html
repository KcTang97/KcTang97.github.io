  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <h2><p> I am Kaicong Tang. I like to draw because it's easy and the only skill I good at. After I study about art and the history,  </p>
    <p> I realize art is not that easy as I think it is. It is complex and meaningful. Art is a platform for artist to perform themselves.   </p>
    <p> I guess this is why I care about as an artist. A place to express my thought and the world in my perspective.  </p>
    <p> I want to explore the things that we commonly ignore daily, just like my second and last projects. Oftentime I create my work is because it is fun to see how it will turns out.  </p>
    <p> Moreoever, I just produce what pops up in my head in first sign. It maybe comes from the news I watch.  </p>
    <p> The feeling I have on that day, or just a sudden inspiration. </p></h2>
  <br>
 <h2>
   <p> In the processes of making these video, I slowly realize my purpose of creating them, I want to create something about me, and the world I observe. </P>
   <p> At first, I only think about how to complete the assignment for a good grade, but I fall into it after I spend the hard work during the process.</P>
   <p> And I enjoy the process of making these video that I like. So, later in the project, I try to add some personal element and some daily issue I experience in public into the video for the tryout.</P>
   <p>And lately, my second and final project video came out. I continue my concept after a few critiques in class and get to know people's comment about the work. I start to understand the value behind all these and interest.</p>
