    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <h2><p> My art practice is to explore new media incorporate with the limited knowledge and skills I learned from classes. </p>
        <p> During the processes of making these digital art pieces, I slowly realize my goals. </p>
        <p> I like to explore the things that we commonly pay less attention like the projects I have done in Art 75 and 74.</p>
        <p> However, I create works based on curiosity and interest in the medium and how it results differently than others.  </p>
        <p> I like to compose any inspirations that flash in my head. It maybe comes from the news or events that I experienced or the emotion of a memory scene.  </p>
        <p> But, I want to create something personal, and my perspective of the world. </p>
        <p> Therefore,  in 2019, the projects I have done, I try to implement personal elements and events that I experienced in the works for the experiment. </P>
        <p> I continue to develop my style digitally after the critiques and lessons from classes.</P>
        <p> The goals of my works mostly are to experiment with each different medium that I don't familiar with and use them to express my emotional world and my ideology.</P>
