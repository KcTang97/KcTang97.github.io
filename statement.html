  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am Kaicong Tang. I like to draw because it's easy and the only skill I good at. After I study about art and the history,
     I realize art is not that easy as I think it is. It is complex and meaningful. Art is a platform for artist to perform themselves.
     I guess this is why I care about as an artist. A place to express my thought and the world in my perspective.
     I want to explore the things that we commonly ignore daily, just like my second and last projects. Oftentime I create my work is because
   it is fun to see how it will turns out. Moreoever, I just produce what pops up in my head in first sign. It maybe comes from the news I watch.
 the feeling I have on that day, or just a sudden inspiration. And I keep editing it, improve it until it matches the perfect form in my brain.</p>
